
THE BASH SHELL:

### bash command

Short for "Bourne-Again Shell," bash is a Unix shell. Originally released in 1989 as a free replacement for the Bourne Shell, 
bash is part of the GNU project.

Bash is the default shell in macOS, Windows Subsystem for Linux, and the majority of Linux operating systems.

Description
bash is a sh-compatible command language interpreter that executes commands read from the standard input or from a file.
 bash also incorporates useful features from the Korn and C shells (ksh and csh).

bash is intended to be a conformant implementation of the Shell and Utilities portion of the IEEE POSIX specification 
(IEEE Standard 1003.1). bash can be configured to be POSIX-conformant by default.
